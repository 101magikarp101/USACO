# Michael Xiang's Competitive Programming Repository
This repo currently holds all of the code I have written for all the competitive programming competitions I have competed in. Of course, there are some random files in here that I used to test some basic code or just to mess around in general.

### Naming Conventions

In general, the names of the folders describe what competition or what type of practice was done in the folder, with a few exceptions

"882-2" means a the Codeforces #882 Div. 2 round  
"cc-140" means the CodeChef #140 round

### Some Interesting Things

Looking through this repo chronologically, you can really see how my coding style has changed. from the first USACO competitions I did to the DP problems I do now.
